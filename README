This is a quick script designed to allow you to quickly deploy Magento setups.  It was written to scrach a personal itch, but feature requests and bug reports are always welcome.

There are some things I will be adding over time to make it even quicker but as it stands it will;

Create a new user for the site.
Create a new folder setup.
Create a new database.
Download whichever version of Magento you want.
Set up that version of Magento.

Useage

Set the persmissions on the script with something like sudo chmod u+x mkmagento.sh

Call it with three parameters; username, password, magento version eg;

./mkmagento.sh superstoresite secretpassword123 1.4.1.0

You can follow the progress of this script on my blog at - http://tosbourn.com/category/magento-auto-install/

Cheers
